# Agora Lab Blog

Welcome to the **Agora Lab Blog**! This is an open-source platform where anyone can contribute their insights, research, and thoughts on artificial intelligence & machine learning. Our goal is to build a rich resource of knowledge that reflects the vibrant community around AI.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from all members of the AI community. To submit a blog post, please follow the steps below:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository to create a copy of it under your GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Folder**: Navigate to the `posts` folder in your local copy of the repository. Here, create a new folder for your post. The name of this folder should be unique and use underscore separation (e.g., `understanding_swarms`).

3. **Add Your Post**: Inside your new post folder, create an `index.qmd` file. In this file, begin with a YAML header that includes the following required fields:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "Your Blog Title"
    description: "A brief description of your blog post."
    author: "Your Name"
    date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    image: "your_thumbnail.png"
    categories: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
    bibliography: references.bib
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 3
    nocite: |
    @*
    ---
    ```

   Hereâ€™s an example header for reference:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "Understanding Swarms: Coordinated Intelligence for Complex Problem Solving"
    description: "An in-depth look at the Swarms framework, which allows scalable multi-agent collaboration using AI. Discover how agents work together to perform complex tasks autonomously."
    author: "Jack Tol"
    date: "2024-09-05"
    image: "thumbnail.png"
    categories: [AI, multi-agent systems, swarms, open-source, automation]
    bibliography: references.bib
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 3
    nocite: |
    @*
    ---
    ```

4. **Write Your Blog**: Below the YAML header, write your blog content using Markdown formatting.

5. **Preview Your Changes**: Before submitting your changes, it is highly recommended that you render your blog locally. To do this, you will need to install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), a tool for rendering Markdown documents. Follow the installation instructions provided on the Quarto documentation site.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: After you have written and previewed your blog, commit your changes and submit a pull request to the main repository. A review team will go through your submission, and if approved, we will reach out to you about publishing your blog!
