Agora Lab is an open-source collective of AI researchers and engineers dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence for the betterment of humanity. Guided by core principles such as **Humanity First**, open collaboration, and a focus on high-impact projects, Agora is pushing the boundaries of AI in areas like **multi-modal learning**, **adaptability**, and **collaborative intelligence**.

Our research is open-source, making it accessible for anyone to explore, contribute, or build upon. While core project development is managed by a dedicated team, we welcome community involvement through pull requests, feedback, and forks of our work.

Key projects include **Swarms**, a system enabling multiple AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks, and **Zeta**, a modular AI development framework designed for high-performance and efficiency across multiple modalities.

To connect with our community, join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/t5QxhyvUG9). If you're interested in joining the Agora Research team, contact Kye Gomez at kye@swarms.world.
