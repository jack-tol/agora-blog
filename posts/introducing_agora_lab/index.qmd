## Section 1 | Introduction

Agora Lab is an open-source collective of AI engineers and creators with a clear mission: to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) for the betterment of humanity. Guided by core principles like “Humanity First,” open collaboration, and a focus on projects with broad, positive impacts, Agora is pushing the boundaries of AI, while keeping its work transparent and accessible to all.

While the research at Agora is open source and publicly available, participation in the core projects is organized and maintained by a team of dedicated contributors. However, we encourage collaboration from the broader AI community through feedback, pull requests, and forks. This structure ensures a balance between openness and effective project management.

Our GitHub repository is home to numerous projects, 30 at the time of writing, including key initiatives like **Swarms** and **Zeta**, as well as a wide array of paper implementations, training/inference scripts, and AI applications [@AgoraLab2024].

## Section 2 | Our Core Values at Agora Lab

At Agora, everything we do is driven by a set of guiding principles that shape our approach to AI:

1. **Humanity First**: Every project is designed with one goal in mind: to improve life for people around the world. Whether we’re working on AI solutions for healthcare, education, or large-scale automation, the goal is always the same: advancing humanity.
   
2. **Open Source**: We believe in the power of transparency. All of our research is open source, from start to finish. Even when projects are in the early stages, or when we’re still working through challenges, everything is shared publicly to encourage collaboration and accelerate learning.

3. **High Impact**: Our focus is on projects that have the potential to make a real difference. By working on initiatives like multi-modal learning systems and collaborative AI, we aim to improve the quality of life for millions of people, not just a select few.

## Section 3 | Areas of Research Focus

Agora’s research is all about pushing AI forward in ways that make it more intelligent, adaptive, and useful in real-world applications. Our research focuses on three key areas:

- **Multi-Modal AI**: This involves enabling AI systems to process and reason with multiple types of data, like text, images, and audio, simultaneously. By integrating these different streams of information, we’re working to make AI smarter and more contextually aware.
  
- **Adaptability**: We want our AI models to be as adaptable as possible. This means creating systems that can be fine-tuned in real time, allowing them to respond quickly to new information and evolving situations.

- **Reasoning and Collaboration**: We’re especially interested in improving the reasoning capabilities of AI, using techniques like the Tree of Thoughts or Forest of Thoughts, which allow models to think through problems in a more human-like way. Additionally, we’re exploring ways to scale up collective intelligence, where multiple AI agents work together to tackle complex tasks.

## Section 4 | Highlighted Projects: Swarms and Zeta

Agora Lab is constantly innovating, and two standout projects are **Swarms** and **Zeta**. These projects demonstrate our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI, particularly in the areas of collaboration and performance.

### 4.1 | Swarms: Unlocking the Power of Collective AI

The **Swarms** project focuses on creating systems where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve problems. Instead of a single AI handling a task, Swarms enables hundreds, or even thousands, of AI agents to work together. This approach opens up new possibilities for distributed AI tasks and the exploration of emergent behaviors.

### 4.2 | Zeta: A Modular Approach to AI Development

The **Zeta** project is about building high-performance AI models using modular building blocks. Zeta allows developers to quickly prototype, train, and optimize models across multiple modalities, streamlining AI development through ease of use and efficiency.

## Section 5 | How to Get Involved

Agora Lab welcomes contributions from the AI community in a variety of ways. While core project development is managed by a dedicated team, we offer numerous opportunities for you to engage with our work and contribute meaningfully:

- **Daily Paper Club**: Join us every night as we review and discuss the latest AI research papers. This is a great way to stay on top of the newest developments in the field and connect with other AI enthusiasts.
  
- **Paper Implementation Night**: Participate in live coding sessions where we work together to implement new research papers in PyTorch. These hands-on sessions help deepen your understanding of AI models and techniques.

- **Community Meetings**: Every Saturday, we host a meeting to discuss the progress of our research and the challenges we face. It’s a chance to get updates on our projects, ask questions, and share your ideas.

- **Collaborate on Projects**: If you're passionate about AI and want to contribute, you can get involved by forking our repositories or submitting pull requests to improve existing projects. However, major contributions and resource allocation decisions are handled by the core team to ensure effective progress.

You can also join the community by joining our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/t5QxhyvUG9), where we discuss ongoing projects, research ideas, and other AI topics with like-minded individuals. If you're interested in becoming part of the Agora Research team, please reach out to Kye Gomez at kye@swarms.world.
